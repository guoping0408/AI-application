# Complete AI Workflow Tutorial (Training + Inferencing)
**This tutorial uses NVIDIA DIGITS for training custom deep neural networks and Nvidia DeepStream SDK for inferencing. I will introduce how to use tools provided by NVIDIA to build your first AI application for object detection**


------------


Hardware Prerequisites:

		1. A Host PC with Unbuntu 16.04 or above installed
		2. NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti (recommended) -- Training side
		3. NVIDIA TX2 -- Inferencing side
# Trainingâ€”DIGITS(NVIDIA Deep Learning GPU Training System)

 > **note**: To avoid most dependency issues while using DIGITS and to allow users have more control of their installation environment, I give the somewhat more advanced ways of setting up the DIGITS environments.

## Installing NVIDIA Driver on the Host PC

Assuming you have already use JetPack 4.2 to flash your TX2 or other Jetson, and installed CUDA toolkits on your host PC during the flashing process. If you use other version of JetPack, it's recommended that you have use **CUDA 10.0**, since it supports the NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti graphic card.
