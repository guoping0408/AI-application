# Complete AI Workflow Tutorial (Training + Inferencing)
**This tutorial uses Nvidia DIGITS for training custom deep neural networks and Nvidia DeepStream SDK for inferencing.**


------------


Hardware Prerequisites:

		1. A Host PC installed with Unbuntu 16.04 or above
		2. NVIDIA GTX 2080 Ti (recommended) -- Training side
		3. NVIDIA TX2 -- Inferencing side
		
#DIGITS(NVIDIA Deep Learning GPU Training System)

 > **note**: To avoid most dependency issues while using DIGITS and to allow users have more control of their installation environment, I give the somewhat more advanced ways of setting up the DIGITS environments. Hopefully this will save you significant amout of time debugging the dependencies issues.
